    <hl>Day 6 Reflection</hl>
    <p>Today I experimented with Python and saw that there were multiple similarities between Python and Scratch. They both use commands and booleans to identify certain variables. With Python though, it's more complicated due to the fact that you have to run it differently than in Scratch. It was harder to debug code since everything wasn't directly side by side. You had to run the code to make sure it worked seperately than in Scratch. </p>
