    <p> Working with Arduino was interesting because I wasn't aware that you had to pay attention to make sure certain sides of the LED 
  were in the ground or not. I also wasn't aware of what an anode or cathode meant. When working with the LEDs and resistors it was hard 
  to decipher which ports they each went through. </p>
